# TravelJournalReact

Some sheananigans with React. Basically, easy exercise with mapping throught list of objects that are then rendered as card components using
object properties. Also, this is first time I used spread props operator and even thought it may not be as readable as, for example, passing an object as a props,
I think I will stick to using it.
